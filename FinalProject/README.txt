This is the instructions to run the codes properly.
Open your preferred java IDE to run the codes, everything needed to run the codes is already written in the code.
The codes are in the folder (src).
Copy every code into your IDE and run.

First problem: Hashing:
     -It is saved in the project under a class named "Hashing" which contains the whole program.
     -You are just required to enter a string in the same line to return the required results.

Second problem: Binary Search Tree:
      -It is save in the project under a class named "BinarySearchTree" which contains the whole program.

Third problem: Topological Sorting:
      -It is saved in the project under a package named "topologicalsorting" which contains all the classes of the program.
      -The code doesn't require any special installments for it to run properly.
      -The used graph must be acyclic, otherwise the program will not return the required results.
      -You will be asked to enter 3 integers space separated in a single line, then 2 integers space separated in each line for a number of times equal to the number of graph edges.

Fourth problem: Minimum Spanning Trees:
      -It is saved in the project under a class named "MinimumSpanningTrees" which contains the whole program.
